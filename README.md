### TEST MIGRATION Service

API3 Project channel: **[#ask-console-platform](https://siftscience.slack.com/archives/CD4VA65DX)**

#### Project Description
The service handles all REST APIs that back the console. Also contains a lot of other misc APIs, such as the ones used directly by our customers for passing decisions, integrating on the input side of Sift Connect, and some other legacy APIs that are called directly by customers.

[More about the service can be found here.](https://sift.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/RNDTEAM/pages/1587347717/Intro+to+Developing+on+API3)
